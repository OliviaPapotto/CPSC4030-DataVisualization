## Files
The Excel files in this repository are the data we pulled from Spotify's API. The python file spotifygrabber.py is the script we wrote to convert the csv files we downloaded from spotifycharts.com to include the genres for each of the songs.

## Sources
To develop our website with d3 graphs, we modeled our initial graph from the class notes titled "My first map in GeoJSON". Then to get only North and South America, we used https://geojson-maps.ash.ms/ to get obtain a json file of the Americas. Lastly, the music note shortcut icon came from https://findicons.com/icon/80722/music.
