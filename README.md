## Files
The Excel files in this repository are the data we pulled from Spotify's API. The python file spotifygrabber.py is the script we wrote to convert the csv files we downloaded from spotifycharts.com to include the genres for each of the songs.

A brief description of our files is as follows,
- !MASTERFILE.xlsx - A combination of all countries and their top songs with the calculations for each graph (aka the original dataset with calculations)
- Country by Genre.xlsx - The countries and their most prominent genre on 10/11/20
- Country by Total Streams.xlsx - The countries and their total number of streams on 10/11/20
- Genre Popularity.xlsx - The popularity of each genre on 10/11/20 

## Work Organization
To divide up our work, Olivia did the html/css coding portion of the website as she has more experience in that area and David worked on the calculations within the dataset getting the derived data we needed from each original file along with refining the code in Observable. Both members worked on creating the visualizations within Observable.

## Sources
To develop our website with d3 graphs, we modeled our initial graph from the class notes titled "My first map in GeoJSON". Then to get only North and South America, we used https://geojson-maps.ash.ms/ to get obtain a json file of the Americas. Lastly, the music note shortcut icon came from https://findicons.com/icon/80722/music.
