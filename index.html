<h1>Milestone 4 Project - Visualizing Spotify Data in North and South America</h1>
<h2>CPSC 4030 - David Cherne & Olivia Papotto</h2>  

<body>

    <p>Our Milestone 4 Project consists of gathering data from Spotify's API
        and finding trends within the number of streams on October 11th, 2020 
        and the different kinds of genres listened to within North and South America.
        The data was gathered from www.spotifycharts.com, a Spotify website that shows the 
        Top 200 Songs, filtered by location (globally or within a specific country), 
        time frame (daily or weekly), and the date (ranging from present day to 01/01/17).
    </p>

    <p>After first discovering the data on the Spotify Charts website, we
        became curious as to how different genres trend across the Americas and overall wondered
        how different countries listen to music. This resulted in the creation of three separate graphs.
        Graph 1 explores how many songs were streamed in North and South America, based off of the top 200 songs for 10/11/20.
        Graph 2 looks at the genre that was overall most popular on 10/11/20. Lastly, Graph 3 looks at the
        popularity of the Top 5 Genres in the Americas (Latin, Pop, Rap, Hip-Hop, and Carioca) for each country. This was
        computed by taking the amount of streams for one genre, divided by the total streams in North and South America for that same genre.  
    </p>

    <p>To see each of the different graphs, simply scroll through the page to see each of the three graphs. 
       You can hover over the countries to see their name, as well as specifics for the data that is relevant to that graph.
       For some countries, Spotify did not release any data for; these countries are still present on the map, however do not include specific data.  </p>
