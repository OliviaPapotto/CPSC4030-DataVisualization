<h1>Milestone 4 Project - Visualizing Spotify Data in North and South America</h1>
<h2>CPSC 4030 - David Cherne & Olivia Papotto</h2>

    <p>Our Milestone 4 Project consists of gathering data from Spotify's API
        and finding trends within the number of streams on October 11th, 2020 
        and the different kinds of genres listened to within North and South America.
        The data was gathered from www.spotifycharts.com, a Spotify website that shows the 
        Top 200 Songs, filtered by location (globally or within a specific country), 
        time frame (daily or weekly), and the date (ranging from present day to 01/01/17).
    </p>

    <p>After first discovering the data on the Spotify Charts website, we
        became curious as to how different genres trend across the Americas and overall wondered
        how different countries listen to music. This resulted in the creation of three separate graphs.
        Graph 1 explores how many streams of the Top 200 songs North and South America had on 10/11/20. 
        Graph 2 looks at the genre that is overall most popular on 10/11/20. Lastly, Graph 3 looks at the
        popularity of the Top 5 Genres in the Americas (Latin, Pop, Rap, Hip-Hop, and Carioca). This was
        computed by _.  
    </p>

    <p>To see each of the different graphs, simply select the desired genre from the list. 
        Next, simply hover over the different countries to see their name and the number of streams or 
        the genre that is most prevelant for the graph. For Graph 3, first select a genre then </p>
